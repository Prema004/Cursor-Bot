## 🧪 Working On: CursorBot

I’m actively evolving **RoboTrack** into **CursorBot** — a more refined version that includes:

- More precise cursor tracking mechanics
- Improved robot animation and directional rotation
- Adaptive designs for touch and mobile devices
- Planned enhancements with optional JavaScript support (future scope)

Stay tuned for **CursorBot** releases and live demos!

## 🎯 How It Works

- The robot is designed using `div`s and styled using CSS.
- Directional responses are handled using CSS `transform`, `transition`, and pseudo-classes like `:hover` or `@keyframes`.
- Cursor movement direction is mimicked using smart positioning and rotation based on hover regions or tracking logic.

## 💡 Inspiration

This project showcases how far **CSS** can go in creating interactive effects without a single line of JavaScript. It’s perfect for those learning frontend fundamentals and creative UI experiments.
